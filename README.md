# Weather-Project
I have made a Web Application wherein you can give your city as an input and the website will display the live weather conditions in that city at that time.
I have used basic HTML to design the page.
I have used JS and node.js to handle the POST and GET requests.
I have also used the openweathermap API to get the live weather data.
